Beginning my first live Project :- 
To get involved in any application software or building a system, 
Our  first prerequisite should be to know what is a system?. 

-'A system is a set of components that interacts to accomplish some purpose'.

And then getting to know 'how a sytem a works?'. 

-For this I've learned SDLC (System Development Life Cycle), that gives a full description about how to design a whole system. 

This cycle includes 7 stages :- 

1. Recognition of need 
2. Preliminary investigation/feasibility study 
3. Analysis 
4. Design 
5. Implementation
6. Testing 
7. Post implementation and maintenance
